##Title
Averages of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

##Description
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

This script creates a data set by doing two major transformations: 1) extracts the mean and standard deviation measurements of the Human Activity Recognition database mentioned above and 2) computes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
